"I was impressed with Samsung’s success and visions for the upcoming years 
as well as the global reputation in various industry area. 
(for example, the mobile phone has a strong point against competitors.
Samsung has world best technologies on both H/W and S/W but Apple doesn't.)

I would be honored to work for a company like yours and I am confident 
that my background, experience, and skills can be put to use while contributing 
to the companies mission." 
Personally, if i work for SDS I would feel like returning home after long journey.

ANS,
“What interests me most about this position is the opportunity for me to work 
hands-on with my current job skills. 
I would be happy to adding my expierence here and passing on my Java, Python 
and Django knowledge.”

4. Why should we hire you?

ANS,
“No one can learn software engineering in two months, or six, or even a year. 
I have been learning for the past 20 more years and I am still learning today.”
Software engineers do not think of their career as just writing programs. 
They think in terms of satisfying needs and solving problems. 

I believe XXX is growing and bright business model. 
If i can add my experience and programming skills to XXX's groth, it would be 
great opportunity for me as well.


5. What are your strengths?
6. What are your weaknesses?

7. What is your greatest accomplishment?
 <> Python project.
 I think, Python is a general purpose programming language.
 My first Python project(i developed) was Injector API connecting to 
 mainframe via TN3270 IBM terminal emulator.
 It was daily boilerplate regular job to fetch data from the host system
 and to create a report which was used for analysing customer's resource
 usage. It was good to save time for a human not to hang on a routine job. 
 
 And the other cases are,
 When we run 16 MQ hub boxes which create lots of log files,
 So i had to develope an automation program that checks the aged files
 and remove them. And also monitoring servers to check if it's working or not.
 
 Personaly i created my own dictionary program to use, learn & develope
 core python skills like GUI programming(PYQT5), DB access, Networking, 
 SSH connection etc,
 
 <> Django Project.
 My last Django project was MSXViewer which is a RESTful API.
 In brief,
 When the client API calls a request with a URI(endpoint address)
 The server returns the response with JSON format data which is including 
 the MQ definitions. Django REST framework has been used for developement. 
 And it's run on Tomcat as MSXViewer API. It's one of our Microservices APIs.
 
 <> Java Project

 And it's run on Tomcat as MSXViewer API. It's one of our Microservices APIs.
 
 And years ago i was maintaining JBOSS web services(MQHCV).
 which has been used for MQ operation team.
 It consists of 3 packages (Crawler, Feeder, MQHCV) that have to be installed 
 and properly configured so that they can cooperate and communicate together.
 
8. Describe a time you dealt with a conflict at work?

9. Why are you leaving your job?
ANS,
I was happy to work with keep growing Amadeus IT group which is now 
market leading GDS(global distribution services) in the world.
In the 1980s, 
Monolithic mainframes were most popular computer system architectures, 
but Information Technology continues to evolve.
Nowadays, Microservices are the trend of Computer business. 
So our legacy mainfraime suppose to be decommisioned.
It's long story but to say short, Our job has been moved to operations 
which means no more investment for future developement. 
So i'm looking for another company to grow with me for another 10 years. 
I would love nothing more than to work for a growing company such as yours."

17. The most frequently asked RESTful Web services interview questions:
ANS,
Web services, a very well known term when we talk about exchanging 
some sort of data between multiple applications or say software. 
Based on the client-server model(microservices), these services can be 
used by multiple software application written in various languages 
and also it has an advantage of running on various platforms.

Likewise REST, Representational State Transfer is also based on 
stateless client-server style architecture, which can be easily accessed
over the network and is identified by URIs(Uniform Resource Identifier).
