"I am no longer being challenged. Our team continue to request more budget to enhance current product but we seem to be at a standstill.
It's long story but to say short, Our job has been moved to operations which means no more investment for future developement. 
Your company is constantly growing and adapting and the employees seem to be learning something new every day. 
I would love nothing more than to work for a revolutionary company such as yours."

Note,
"For organisations to truly transform, or embark on a digital journey, they need to adopt powerful new technologies 
that enable more flexible workforces and unlock the value from innovations in areas such as AI(artificial intelligence) 
and machine learning.
With almost all of organisations acknowledging that cloud solutions enable them to do this quickly, and at a lower cost 
than setting up in-house, cloud is seen as increasingly critical to doing business.

So far in 2018, SaaS(Software-as-a-Service) is the most utilised cloud service for 65% of Index respondents, 
followed by IaaS(Infrastructure-as-a-Service) (58%) and Security-as-a-Service (49%).

When it came to reaping the benefits of cloud, over half highlighted a more flexible and collaborative IT environment 
as the main benefit, followed by a safer data environment and better remote access.
