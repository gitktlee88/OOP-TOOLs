I was happy to work with keep growing Amadeus IT group which is now

In the 1980s, 
Monolithic mainframes were most popular computer system architectures, 
but IT continues to evolve.
Nowadays, Microservices are the trend of Computer business. 
So our legacy mainfraime suppose to be decommisioned.
It's long story but to say short, Our job has been moved to operations 
which means no more investment for future developement. 
So i'm looking for another company to grow with me for another 10 years. 
I would love nothing more than to work for a growing company such as yours."
